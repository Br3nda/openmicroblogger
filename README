  look for the database settings

     # database settings

      development:
        adapter: mysql        // 'mysql' or 'postgresql'
        database: microblog   // name of database

////////////////////////////
// choose a file upload mode
////////////////////////////

1) upload as SQL BLOBs (default)
      
      maximum upload size is 5MB or so, not that great for big MP3s, but maximizes privacy
      
      you must set the /cache folder permissions so the Flash uploader can put files there

2) upload as SQL BLOBs (WITH CACHING)

      first set up your /cache folder as described in option 1
      
      then, edit config.yml

   look for

      collection_cache:
      - posts:
        duration : 0        // and change this 0 to the number of seconds to cache
        location : cache

3) upload FILES to /uploads (do not create BLOBs)

      set permissions on the /cache and /uploads folders
      
      next, edit config.yml
   
   look for
   
      collection_cache:
      - posts:
        duration : 0
        location : cache    // and change 'cache' to 'uploads'

4) upload FILES to Amazon S3 (do not create BLOBs)

      set permissions on the /cache folder
      
      then, edit config.yml
   
   look for
   
      collection_cache:
      - posts:
        duration : 0
        location : cache    // and change 'cache' to 'aws'

   look for

      awsAccessKey:         // and put your AWS login info here
      awsSecretKey: 
      awsBucket:
